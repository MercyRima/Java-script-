DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NULL AND UNDEFINED.

Undefined is when a variable has been declared but it has not yet been assigned a value wherefore null is an assignment value that can be assigned
 to a variable to represent no value. In short, both null and undefined in Javascript indicate absence of value.
